Heya heres some simple documentation for a simple script:

The script takes up to two command line arguments, pass the script without them and it will attempt to locate a "images" folder in your current working directory to find images to convert!
NOTE: By default (no second command line arg) the script will replace all images in the directory with newly formatted copies.

The first command line argument is used to specify the source path for images (a directory) and the second command line argument is used to specify a destination folder for the newly formatted
images should you choose to want to keep the originals.
